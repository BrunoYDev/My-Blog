## System online. Connection established. Welcome.

You've just jacked into my personal corner of the web. If things feel a little different here, that's by design. My name is Bruno, and while I was born in 2003, my digital soul feels most at home somewhere around 1999.

I'm a backend developer by passion, which means I love building the engines, the logic, and the systems that hum quietly behind the scenes. This site is my playground for both that logic and for a visual style I deeply admire: the wild, creative, and unapologetically unique web of the Y2K era.

### So, what is this place?

Think of it as a time capsule and a laboratory.

* **A Devlog:** A place where I'll document my journey as a developer, sharing what I'm learning, building, and the games I'm tinkering with on [itch.io](https://ykkos2.itch.io/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/brunoydev).
* **A Tribute:** A love letter to a time before monolithic social media platforms, when every personal site was a unique expression of its creatorâ€”complete with weird backgrounds, chaotic GIFs, and a lot of personality.
* **A Media Journal:** My thoughts on sci-fi (I'm a huge Doctor Who fan), classic games, 80s anime, and the retro-futuristic vibes of City Pop and Neonwave music.

> The goal is to keep this space simple and stylish, a direct line from my brain to your screen. No language selectors, no cookie banners, just pure, unfiltered content.

While the site is in English (mostly because I feel like it), the **Guestbook** is a multilingual zone. Feel free to leave a message in whatever language you're comfortable with.

Thanks for dropping by. I hope you enjoy the trip back in time.
