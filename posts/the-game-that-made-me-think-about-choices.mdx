# The alters - A game about your choices

---

### I'm going to divide this post in chapters to better understanding and reading, i'm not a good writer i never really posted nothing much serious but this game hit me in a way i can't explain but write about it.

## Chapter 1 - What is "The Alters" ?

    The alters is a game about managing a spaceship, to be more exact is a game about managing resources in an abandoned planet, you and your crew are in a mission to collect resources of a distant planet, but when you all are entering in the planet atmosphere something happens and you wake up in the planet trying to communicate with someone but no one responds your calls, so you decide to search for your ship.

<CenteredImage src="/postImages/the-game-that-made-me-think-about-choices/earlyGameplay.gif" alt="The alters GIF" width={400} height={250} />

    After a little parkour gameplay in search of your ship, you finally find it, you enter the ship and… No one in there, you run to the communication room and try to call someone
in the earth, a strange person respond you but you can barely understand what is he saying, but some words are understandable and the strange person guides you to make the ship starts walking,
(I forgot to mention, you're just a builder in the crew so you don't know how to pilot the ship yet, and the ship is like a land vehicle).

&#x20;    So, you try to start the ship engines and KABOOM, the engine explodes and all the ship controls broke, you run to tell the strange person what happened and the person tells you that the ship have a Quantum Computer... basically the QC can read your mind records and simulate a new life where you make other choices. But not only that, you and your crew mission are to collect a mineral called "Rapidium", this mineral can boost organic evolution, like plants, animals and of course human corpses, you can transform a baby in a adult in like 18 hours.    &#x20;

      The idea is to create a new consciousness and implant in a cloned body (All this chapter I'm been calling you as the protagonist but he has a name Jan Dolski or Janek Dolski). Obviously Jan asks the ethics about cloning yourself but in his situation ethics are the less important thing so he does, In Jan mind records you can read all his life, his traumas, his happiness all of it, the first mind record you create are the Mechanic.

## Chapter 2 - Jan Dolski

    Before i continue in the game mechanic and the other "Jans" i want to talk about the first Jan, the player's Jan. When you enter in QC(Quantum Computer) you can see all the Jan's timeline, the QC focus is the core life choices, the choices that made difference in your life.

<CenteredImage src="/postImages/the-game-that-made-me-think-about-choices/janTimeline.gif" alt="Jan's Life Timeline" width={616} height={298} />

    I can't remember all the story bubbles because when you select a choice to change you can create another ramification creating more choices to create other alters, there's a total of 10 alters in the game. Well, Jan has some life traumas like, with his father, Jan's father was an abusive alcoholic who always went home extremely drunk and arguing with his mother and of course hit her, in this story bubble the first ramification appears, the Jan in his story doesn't argue with his father he just walk away from home, this is one of the various choices he regret made.

   Seeing all the story bubbles you see that Jan isn't a superhero or something he is just a normal guy with many life regrets like everyone, but most people (Jan included) don't think too much about it ( unless you have anxiety, in this case you think a lot in this things ), but when Jan read your own mind records he sees and remember his life, his regrets.

    All the time the game either implicitly or explicitly using the NPCs tries to make you think of the alters as clones not alternative versions, but when time passes and the Jan interact with the others "Jans" he realizes how creep all this is because he sees that all alters are completely different from him and one from another.
