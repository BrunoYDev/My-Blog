# The alters - A game about your choices

---

### I'm going to divide this post in chapters to better understanding and reading, i'm not a good writer i never really posted nothing much serious but this game hit me in a way i can't explain but write about it.

## Chapter 1 - What is "The Alters" ?

    The alters is a game about managing a spaceship, to be more exact is a game about managing resources in an abandoned planet, you and your tripulation are in a mission
to collect resources of a distant planet, but when you all are entering in the planet atmosphere something happens and you wake up in the planet trying to comunicate with someone
but no one responds your calls, so you decide to search for your ship.

    After a little parkour gameplay in search of your ship, you finally find it, you enter the ship and… No one in there, you run to the communication room and try to call someone
in the earth, a strange person respond you but you can barely understand what is he saying, but some words are understandable and the strange person guides you to make the ship starts walking,
(I forgot to mention, you're just a builder in the crew so you don't know how to pilot the ship yet, and the ship is like a land vehicle).

&#x20;    So, you try to start the ship engines and KABOOM, the engine explodes and all the ship controls broke, you run to tell the strange person what happened and the person tells you that the ship have a Quantum Computer... basically the QC can read your mind records and simulate a new life where you make other choices. But not only that, you and your crew mission are to collect a mineral called "Rapidium", this mineral can boost organic evolution, like plants, animals and of course human corpses, you can transform a baby in a adult in like 18 hours.    &#x20;

      The idea is to create a new consciousness and implant in a cloned body (All this chapter I'm been calling you as the protagonist but he has a name Jan Dolski or Janek Dolski). Obviously Jan asks the ethics about cloning yourself but in his situation ethics are the less important thing so he does, In Jan mind records you can read all his life, his traumas, his happiness all of it, the first mind record you create are the Mechanic.

## Chapter 2 - Jan Dolski

    Before i continue in the game mechanic and the other "Jans" i want to talk about the first Jan, the player's Jan.
