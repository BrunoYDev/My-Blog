Welcome to my personal blog, a digital playground built as a love letter to the creative, chaotic, and wonderfully personal web of the late 90s and early 2000s.

## üöÄ About This Project

This project is a fully functional, modern web application that embraces the Y2K aesthetics. As a backend-focused developer born in 2003, I wanted to explore frontend technologies while creating a space that rebels against today's templated, uniform web design. This blog is a testament to an era where every website had its own unique soul.

It serves as my personal devlog, diary and a place to share my interests in technology, sci-fi, classic gaming, and music.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **‚úçÔ∏è MDX-Powered Blog:** Posts are written in MDX, allowing for a rich mix of Markdown and custom React components within the content.

* **üìÑ Multi-level Pagination:** Custom pagination components implemented for the main blog, guestbook, and all tag archive pages.

* **üìà Custom Visitor Counter:** A dual-purpose counter built with Vercel KV (Redis) to track both total unique visitors and unique daily visitors.
* **üëæ Custom BSOD 404 Page:** A "Blue Screen of Death"-themed 404 page for a nostalgic error-handling experience.
* **üì± Fully Responsive Design:** Custom CSS ensures the retro aesthetic adapts perfectly to mobile devices, with features like a hamburger menu for navigation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm
* A Vercel account (for environment variables)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/BrunoYDev/My-Blog.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd My-Blog
    ```
3.  Install NPM packages:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  Set up your environment variables. You'll need to connect this project to your own Supabase and Vercel KV instances. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root and add the following variables:
    ```env
    # Supabase
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

    # Vercel KV (Redis)
    KV_URL=YOUR_KV_URL
    KV_REST_API_URL=YOUR_KV_REST_API_URL
    KV_REST_API_TOKEN=YOUR_KV_REST_API_TOKEN
    KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=YOUR_KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN
    
    # Keystatic (for GitHub auth on the deployed site)
    KEYSTATIC_SECRET=CREATE_A_RANDOM_SECRET_STRING
    KEYSTATIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_APP_CLIENT_ID
    KEYSTATIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_APP_CLIENT_SECRET
    ```
    *You can get these values from your Vercel, Supabase, and GitHub project dashboards.*

5.  Run the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
